{"name":"Stat Weight Score","tagline":"WoW WoD addon that calculates a score of an item based on stat weights and the item's stats.","body":"# Change log\r\n\r\n## v1.6\r\n* frFR is now fully supported, including proc/use calculation\r\n* Fixed a bug where want was compared to the offhand instead of main hand\r\n\r\n## v1.5.3 - 28 Mar 2015\r\n* Fixed parsing of stats above 1000\r\n\r\n## v1.5.2 - 27 Mar 2015\r\n* Fixed an onload error\r\n\r\n## v1.5.1 - 27 Mar 2015\r\n* Fixed bonus armor correction calculation for WoW API\r\n\r\n## v1.5 - 27 Mar 2015\r\n* Support for ilvl 715 legendary ring, and crafted trinket Stone of Fire\r\n* Option to select which way to get item stats (WoW API - GetItemStats or parse from tooltip). Parsing from tooltip allows you to have \"greyed out\" stats calculated for you offspec (by default enabled for enUS culture users, because it has a dependency on localization). Others still use WoW API call.\r\n\r\n## v1.4.1 - 15 Mar 2015\r\n* Added Avoidance stat\r\n* Bugfixes\r\n\r\n## v1.4 - 28 Feb 2015\r\n* Total weighted stat score of all equipped items is now calculated and displayed on character stats pane (this can be disabled in options by unchecking **Show total score**)\r\n* By default, the percentage difference in score is now calculated against total score, rather than equipped item. This better shows you how big of an upgrade an item is. //(For example an item that is (+50 +20%) better than current item adds less score than an item that is (+100 +10%), even though the percentage is bigger and that can be misleading. Comparison against total score would show something like (+50 +1%) and (+100 +2%))//. If you preferred the way it was before, you can change it in options by selecting **Compare percentage gain to** - Equipped item score.\r\n* You can now select whether to display percentage as change or difference (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_change_and_difference). See **Calculate percentage as** in options.\r\n* Two handed weapons are now compared to Main hand + Offhand score\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
