Parsing from tooltip allows you to have \"greyed out\" stats calculated for you offspec (by default enabled for enUS culture users, because it has a dependency on localization). Others still use WoW API call.\r\n\r\n## v1.4.1 - 15 Mar 2015\r\n* Added Avoidance stat\r\n* Bugfixes\r\n\r\n## v1.4 - 28 Feb 2015\r\n* Total weighted stat score of all equipped items is now calculated and displayed on character stats pane (this can be disabled in options by unchecking **Show total score**)\r\n* By default, the percentage difference in score is now calculated against total score, rather than equipped item. This better shows you how big of an upgrade an item is. _(For example an item that is (+50 +20%) better than current item adds less score than an item that is (+100 +10%), even though the percentage is bigger and that can be misleading. Comparison against total score would show something like (+50 +1%) and (+100 +2%))_. If you preferred the way it was before, you can change it in options by selecting **Compare percentage gain to** - Equipped item score.\r\n* You can now select whether to display percentage as change or difference (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_change_and_difference). See **Calculate percentage as** in options.\r\n* Two handed weapons are now compared to Main hand + Offhand score\r\n",
